          A passionate MERN stack developer and a problem solver. I am highly
          skilled with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, JS, and React JS, and
          comfortable with Node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB. I have completed
          some projects with the above technologies. I have solved many problems
          in different online judges using c and c++. Now I would like to work
          in an organization where I can implement my knowledge & skills to
          achieve the companyâ€™s goals as well as improve my knowledge.
